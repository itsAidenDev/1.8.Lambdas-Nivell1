# 1.8. Lambdas (Level 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This repository contains solutions for various exercises using **Java 8+ Lambdas and Streams API**. Each exercise demonstrates functional programming techniques such as **filtering, sorting, and using functional interfaces**.

**Exercise 1**

From a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all the strings that contain the letter ‚Äòo‚Äô. Print the result.

**Exercise 2**

You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now the method must return a list of Strings that, in addition to containing the letter ‚Äòo‚Äô, also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

**Exercise 3**

Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all the elements of the list using a lambda.

**Exercise 4**

Perform the same printing as in the previous exercise, but using method reference.

**Exercise 5**

Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that must return a double. From the main() of the main class, instantiate the interface and assign it the value 3.1415. Invoke the method getPiValue() and print the result.

**Exercise 6**

Create a list with names and text strings, then sort the list from the shortest to the longest strings.

**Exercise 7**

Using the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in reverse order, from the longest to the shortest string.

**Exercise 8**

Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called reverse(). This method must receive and return a String. In the main() of the main class, inject the method‚Äôs body into the created interface using a lambda, so that it returns the same string it receives as a parameter but in reverse order. Invoke the instance of the interface, pass a string to it, and check if the result is correct.
